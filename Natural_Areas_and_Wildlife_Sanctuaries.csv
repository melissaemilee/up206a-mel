Gerhardy Wildlife Sanctuary is the largest of Los Angeles County’s fourteen Antelope Valley Wildlife Sanctuaries, covering 547 acres.  Carl O. Gerhardy, a County of Los Angeles Parks and Recreation employee from 1944 -1964, found and recommended the acquisition of many County Parks and Sanctuaries, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors honored his accomplishments by naming this Sanctuary after him.   The Sanctuary is carpeted with seasonal wildflowers ranging from Mojave Lupine, Desert Primrose, Evening Primrose, Hole in the Sand Plant to Mohave Apricot Mallow, and you can observe desert reptiles including the Yucca Night Lizard, Red Racer snake, Long-Nosed Leopard Lizard, and Southern Desert Horned Lizard.  Observe the Antelope Ground Squirrel or a beautiful Violet Green Swallow while enjoying the sanctuary, and let the stunning desert landscape inspire creativity with landscapes that capture the expanse of the Antelope Valley to the west, the Desert Buttes, and the lofty peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains to the south.

Various cacti exist from Golden and Silver Cholla to Beavertail that offer spectacular blossoms in the spring!  The consistent wildflowers bring out the Black Tailed Jackrabbits, and if you haven’t seen the native hare you are in for a treat!  Some mistake these giants for a fox or coyote at first; however, once they jump up to 20 feet in a single bound traveling up to 35 miles per hour, everyone recognizes them as the iconic Jackrabbit!
