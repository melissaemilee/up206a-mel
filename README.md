## Course Description
Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.

The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

In addition to the programming lab sessions, you will be given weekly or bi-weekly "thinking cap" assignments, where you will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues. Be prepared to address various topics from the perspective of your own lived experiences, how it informs the topic, and what kind of research can advance knowledge in a positive way.


## Project Ideas and Objectives
At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

Through my GSR position for the EatWell Pod at UCLA, I hope to start a GIS mapping project of edible landscaping starting this Winter quarter, as well as mapping food resources related to food and land justice. After taking the Sectoral Analysis course my first quarter as a MURP, I also realize that having GIS skills will allow me to take data like restauarants and grocery stores, and spatially map them for organizations/clients like Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance and LA food policy council. I hope to explore fresh food access and urban farming issues spatially using GIS and coding, which will potentially be a capstone project that I will propose in my second year as a MURP.
