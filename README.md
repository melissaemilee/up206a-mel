**Pronouns:** _they/them/theirs_ 

MURP 2021-2023 (concentration in relationships between people, land, nature, and culture)

I grew up in Tovaangar (Los Angeles basin, So. Channel Islands), lived in Manhatta and greater Lenapehoking over the past 10 years (https://native-land.ca/).
My ancestors have lived in the Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, and Hunan provinces of China. More recently my immediate family immigrated from the islands of Taiwan and Java & Sumatra, Indonesia. Over the past decade, I worked in community-based nonprofits around arts, education, and social services progarams, and also as a cultural organizer supporting anti-gentrification movements in New York City and Chinatowns across the US. My academic background is in the humanities (art history and film).

What drew me to graduate school for urban planning is my continued interest and desire to support placekeeping and land stewardship. I hope to use GIS and Spatial Data analysis toward imagining and planning futures that consider how people in the places I am connected to can thrive while living through the inevitable reality of climate change.

Some skills and knowledge I can offer toward a collaborative project in this class is my familiary with California and Tri-State New York regions, as well as Indonesia and Metro-Paris region in France. I can read and write French. I have exported and edited maps in Adobe Illustrator and InDesign, and can do design and other visual formatting and presentation work as needed. I am also familiar with aspects of smallscale landscaping and agriculture practices such as permaculture, as well as food justice issues through my GSR with the EatWell Pod at the Healthy Campus Initiative. I also have experience working and conducting research from oral histories and archives.

## Course Description
UP 206A will prepare us for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances research from a data science perspective.

Goals of the course is to expose us to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

We will learn through programming lab sessions and "thinking cap" assignments where we will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues.


## Course Objectives
At the conclusion of this course, we should be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research:

Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps


## Personal Project Ideas & Goals
I am interested in using GIS in support of community led planning and land stewardship that centers both human and non-human stakeholders toward liveable futures and sustainable ecologies in light of climate change in the Anthropocene. In my approach to considering data and spatial analysis, I would like to practice accountability that respects the sovereignty and wishes of the commununities who live or have inhabited the land previously. I also hope that the work I put out can be accessible and legible outside of academic and professional fields.

Data I would love to try to access around food access:

Through my GSR position for the EatWell Pod at UCLA, I hope to collaboratively advance a GIS mapping project of edible natural resources or map food resources related to food and land justice (this could be overlaying data around agricultural land, food businesses, and demographic characteristics). After taking the Sectoral Analysis course last quarter to focus on the restaurant industry, having GIS skills would allow me to take spatial data of places like restauarants and grocery stores, and  map them for organizations/clients like Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance and LA food policy council to support advocacy and organizing. I hope to explore fresh food access and urban farming issues spatially and holistically in relation to other urban development and natural resource considerations using GIS and coding, which will potentially be a capstone project that I will propose in my second year as a MURP.
